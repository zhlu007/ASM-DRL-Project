# ASM-DRL: Adaptive Service Migration with Deep Reinforcement Learning, which has been submitted to Electronics Journal

This repository contains the implementation of ASM-DRL, a deep reinforcement learning–based adaptive service migration framework for Satellite Edge Computing (SEC).  
The method is built upon the Soft Actor–Critic algorithm, with key improvements including:
- An Inter-Satellite Link (ISL) Volatility Coefficient that captures dynamic network stability.  
- A dual-Critic architecture to mitigate Q-value overestimation.  
- An adaptive entropy adjustment mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.
